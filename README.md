##### **Description**
***
- This app will be an interconnected and lightly communicative place for both Streamers and Streaming fans alike to be able to keep track of and interact with each other's streams!
- Directly connected to the iternationnaly known streaming service twitch, this app will give both streamers and viewers the ability to track, like, and comment on their favorite streamer's streams and even see a streaming schedule unique to the streamers exclusive of Twitch!
-Twitch is a beautiful streaming platform, but both it and the Discord servers meant to help manage it can get very muddy.
This app shall provide ease of use for knowing what people's favorite streamers have posted and give each side a platform to be more interactive outside of solely streams.
-Users will be able to make POSTS that other users can interact with!
-Users will be able to schedule their own/next planned streams
-Users will be able to publish each scheduled stream as a post!
-Users will be able to like and comment on posted/scheduled streams and old posts as well. This is the afforementioned connectivity and dialogue previously expressed.
-Commentors will be able to edit and delete their own comments in case of grammatical error or change of mind.
-Users will be able to view a list of other users they follow and of who follows them.
***
-Viewing the App from the outside will show the public display of streams from all involved who have posted any, BUT
logging in with your Twitch account will give you interactive access, so that once another user is followed, you can make comments on their posts/streams!

(-Likes may or may not be a user-authenticated feature. Streamer or not, we like what we like, and big like numbers looks good for one's following)
